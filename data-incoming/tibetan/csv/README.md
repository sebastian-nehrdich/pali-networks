The Tibetan files are organized as thus: 
Each line:
"absolute position number", "name of the segment (globally unique)","tibetan text","quote1","quote2","quote3" etc. 
Each quote: 
Score#textname#beginning position of quote#end position of quote#segment name#Tibetan Text
The actually quoted text is printed in UPCASE. 
I plan to use a similar layout for the new generation of Sanskrit and PƒÅli files as well.
